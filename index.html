		This is a place to find anything and everything about fake skate related content. Fake Skate can be anything from Skater XL to Session, 
		and even older games like the Skate series! Could also be from THPS but I never saw a fake skate edit from that game, haha. Any video 
		game related skateboarding content basically is what you will find here. There could be more content of one game than another game but 
		dont fret, we are all here for the same thing. Fake Skate! Email me here <a href="mailto:skate.or.split.2001@gmail.com">skate.or.split.2001@gmail.com</a> 
		for more info or to get you fake skate content onto the site.
